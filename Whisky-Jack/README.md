# Whisky Jack
Keeping with the joke originally made by box-look.org member tecu, Whisky Jack is named after a particular type of grey bird. 

Whisky Jack is essentially a forked version of tecu's original dumetella theme. Both themes are intended to fit the newer Greybird GTK 2/3 theme better than shimmerproject.org's default Openbox theme.

I have made a few cosmetic modifications where I see fit and cleaned up the themerc file.

Pro tip: The letterpress effect on window titles (originally by tecu) looks best with a bold font.

Happy computing!
